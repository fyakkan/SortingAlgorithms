# Sorting Algorithms
## Introduction 
Sorting algorithms that arrange the items in a list or array according to certain rules, these rules can be alphabetical order, numerical ascending and descending order. These algorithms serve certain purposes, some of these purposes are that to increase the efficiency of search algorithms and to make analysis possible by given people.
The efficiency of algorithms is measured with the big o notation. Some sorting algorithms may perform better than others. For example, counting sort can have smaller "big o notation "than based on comparison algorithm sort.
This article will try to analyze the following six different sorting algorithms: Merge, Quick, Insertion, Shell, Bubble, Selection Run times will be measured in different programming languages in peer environment and with same dataset. Then it will be analyzed and visualized through graphics.
